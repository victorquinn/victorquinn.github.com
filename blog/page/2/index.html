  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Warm malt extract during brewing so less is wasted.</h2>

<p>When I start the homebrew process, the first step of which is sanitizing all my equipment, I first plug one of my sinks, put my liquid malt extract into it (still in its containers), then fill it with hot water.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/lme1.png"></p>

<p>I pick up the liquid malt extract container from time to time and give it a shake to evenly distribute it throughout the container. I also periodically drain and refresh the hot water it&#8217;s bathed in to keep it hot as the malt extract absorbs the heat. This also melts the glue so the labels can be pulled off easily. You&#8217;ll see in my image above that one has its label all the way off and the other is starting to peel. Removing this makes doubly sure that nothing falls into the wort.</p>

<p>By doing this, it makes the malt extract much more viscous (read: runny) so when it comes time to add it to the wort, less is wasted because more of it runs out while pouring and less sticks to the inside of the container.</p>

<p>Bonus: If using a plastic container with a lid (for example with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5XAQK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000V5XAQK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=victorqcom-20" title="">Briess Liquid Malt Extract</a>) you can do as above, but also, after pouring out the malt extract, you can fill this plastic container with hot water from the tap, shake it around, and pour it into the wort. This will ensure even more of your malt extract makes its way into the wort and little is wasted. This can also be done with an aluminum can but it will be less efficient.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Setup</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve just created your new super awesome node type in Drupal 7 using the (now in core!) Content type editor.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/contenttype1.png"></p>

<p>Now you want to programmatically generate some Super Awesome Content nodes. Some <a href="https://www.google.com">Googling</a> (or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Ducking</a>!) will land you with some snippets that look as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Works with standard node  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Since you&#8217;ve defined a custom content type, you may think something like the following would work great with your new custom node type to set your custom field values:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Attempt with custom node (this will fail!)  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">create_my_node</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, that will fail! Why? Because you can&#8217;t set node custom fields like you may expect with <em>$node->{$key}</em>.</p>

<p><em>In my opinion, this is one thing Drupal 7 got very wrong. I&#8217;ll explain their rationale in a bit after showing the correct way to do this and it does make some sense, but it seems unnecessarily complicated.</em></p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Instead of trying to set those custom field attributes directly, you have to use the following funky syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Successful attempt with custom node (this totally works!)  </span></figcaption>

<p>Huh? What&#8217;s with this <em>[&#8216;und&#8217;][0][&#8216;value&#8217;]</em> stuff?</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s a bit complicated. Let&#8217;s break it down piece by piece</p>

<h4>[&#8216;und&#8217;]</h4>

<p>This first bit is the language to be applied to the field. <em>&#8216;und&#8217;</em> is the key specifying that the language is undefined. This could also be &#8216;en&#8217; or &#8216;de&#8217; or &#8216;fr&#8217; or any other 2 letter language code if a particular language is specified for this field.</p>

<h4>[0]</h4>

<p>This is an array index. For any single value fields like the ones we have, this is just [0]. But it&#8217;s conceivable to have multiple values in which this would kind of make sense. For example, let&#8217;s say our reasons_for_being_awesome field was a multi-value field:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Multi-value field  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">field_reasons_for_being_awesome</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;und&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;value&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Too many to count...&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">field_reasons_for_being_awesome</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;und&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;value&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Reason number 2&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">field_reasons_for_being_awesome</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;und&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;value&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Another reason&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nv">$node</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">field_reasons_for_being_awesome</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;und&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;value&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The most important reason&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">node_save</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$node</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So it makes some sense for the array index to be there, but it&#8217;s somewhat confusing for what is arguably the main use case &#8211; namely trying to assign a single value to a field.</p>

<h4>[&#8216;value&#8217;]</h4>

<p>This may be the oddest piece. There are a few other keys which could be specified here, among them <em>[&#8216;format&#8217;]</em> and <em>[&#8216;summary&#8217;]</em>, but when working programmatically with custom fields, it&#8217;s rare to be setting anything other than <em>[&#8216;value&#8217;]</em>.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p>I think Drupal should be much better here and dropped the ball for developers by not allowing the first method above to work. This [&#8216;und&#8217;][0][&#8216;value&#8217;] mess may make it easier for the system to deal with the input, but it makes things far more difficult/complicated for developers. This is an area where it&#8217;s painfully clear that the Drupal Field API is not a true ORM like <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a> and in my opinion that&#8217;s a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Ideally the system would be able to default to allowing things to be set with just the key and not require developers to specify the language, array index, and value key every single time a value is set to the field.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in October of last year, I wrote an Ubercart plugin for Stripe <sup><a href="#stripe1">[1]</a></sup>, a payment API created to be developer conscious and easy to use. I loved the idea of Stripe <sup><a href="#stripe2">[2]</a></sup> and was using Ubercart for a project and noticed there was no module so I created it.</p>

<p>It was the first contrib module I had created entirely from scratch on my own which made it through the Drupal.org submission process. I&#8217;ve written many custom modules for my employer and for side projects, but this was my first time going through the gauntlet of the review process for getting a contrib module on Drupal.org. For the curious, you can see the whole back and forth on this issue: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1339850">http://drupal.org/node/1339850</a></p>

<p>I recently noticed Stripe links back to my module from their site.<sup><a href="#stripe3">[3]</a></sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Excited to attend the <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation</a> 2012 conference next week!</p>

<p>This will be the first year since 2009 that I will not be attending <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/">DrupalCon</a> <sup><a href="#excitement1">[1]</a></sup> and my conference itch needs scratching.</p>

<p>I find generally that conference excitement manifests itself in a handful of ways.</p>

<h2>New Things!</h2>

<p>My favorite thing about attending a programming conference is the excitement I have during and immediately after for all the new things I will learn at the conference.</p>

<p>Every time I walk out of a room where someone was giving a presentation on a cool new technology or process, in the back of my head I am thinking of how I can work that technology or process into each of my current projects. Or I am pondering what old projects I could revamp or new projects I could start using this technology as a launchpad which were previously out of scope or cost prohibitive.</p>

<p>Setting aside the new things themselves, this type of self-reflection and evaluation is invaluable. I strive for this type of reflection in my everyday life, but it&#8217;s much easier in this type of forum, removed from the daily doldrums of life at the office. Having traveled to a conference, often far away, and broken the routine, it is easier to have this kind of perspective.</p>

<p>New things also inherently bring excitement for their new-ness, particularly for a person like myself. Some people enjoy consistency and sameness and have an aversion to change. I am the exact opposite and view a new thing as a new challenge ready and ripe for besting. It also represents uncharted territory and I am definitely an explorer.</p>

<h2>High Energy Environment</h2>

<p>There is always an extremely high energy level at such conferences.</p>

<p>The speakers have high energy, speaking excitedly about something interesting they have recently worked on in an attempt to proselytize.</p>

<p>This in turn leads me (and others) to similarly get excited about their new thing. This kind of network effect is huge. When high energy people start bouncing ideas off of each other in a sort of feedback loop, great things can result.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Never weary of the cost to implement, I am a constant proponent for whatever will be objectively best.'>
I had a reputation with my co-workers of being the guy with the kooky fringe ideas. This is because I was always excited about the possibility of using new and more efficient concepts in our projects. For someone like me, a conference was like crack. Never weary of the cost to implement, I am a constant proponent for whatever will be objectively best. It always led to interesting meals during conferences with me excitedly ranting about how we could use X for this project or Y for that project with my co-workers offering counterpoints to keep me grounded. I&#8217;m sure they grew weary at times, but my co-workers generally allowed me to indulge.
</span></p>

<p>My first week back after a conference is always absorbed by planning and trying to implement many of the new things I learned at the conference or figuring out a reason why I couldn&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t. I feel like I&#8217;m kicked into high gear, being three times as productive that week as any other while I run on the natural high from learning about new things as most people run on coffee.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote='My employer benefited greatly as a result, but that was not my intent in working like mad.'>
I notice myself staying voluntarily late at work and working much longer hours than normal or necessary which, for a salaried employee, was solely for my own personal enjoyment. My employer benefited greatly as a result, but that was not my intent in working like mad. I was rushing to solve a new puzzle, to conquer a new opponent. I was working purely for enjoyment.
</span></p>

<p>Another high energy aspect is that each of the attendees is there to learn. Almost like a wedding, where another new beginning is celebrated, most attendees are embarking on a journey of their own with a technology. Most attendees get a break from their normal day at the office and this fills them with energy and joy they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have.</p>

<p>Being around people in a natural state of high energy serves to amplify the learning and the network effects of the conference.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>And of course there is the value of networking. Many people go to developer conferences primarily for this aspect.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='It is nearly priceless to compare notes on problems, solved and unsolved, and initiate future collaborations.'>
It is incredibly useful to meet other people doing similar things. It is nearly priceless to compare notes on problems, solved and unsolved, and initiate future collaborations.
</span></p>

<p>There are certainly attendees whose primary mission at a conference is to network. At times this can get a bit predatory, but in general it is a net positive.</p>

<p>Particularly in the open source community, finding that someone else has already solved a problem and is willing to share the solution could save days or weeks or more of developer time.</p>

<p>For a seasoned programmer looking for a job, this is a great way to feel out potential employers. Not only would I be hesitant to work as a programmer at a company that failed to value such events, developer conferences are a great way to be introduced to other employees of a company and see what they are working on. It opens the door to talking with these people directly about their work in a manner that is not easy in everyday business. In the case of an open source technology, conference attendance, sponsorship, and the contribution to sessions by an employer are all indicative of a company that contributes back to open source, values the community aspect, and fosters innovation.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s Not All Rainbows, But It&#8217;s Close</h2>

<p>One major downside is that having someone stand in front of you and preach excitedly about their latest thing can, at times, be misleading.</p>

<p>This is not to say the speakers intentionally or negligently mislead, but each one often discusses the highlights of their new thing without strongly discussing the downsides. This makes sense as their intent at speaking at a conference is generally not purely to educate, but also to drum up support for their new thing or for publicity for their company or themselves. This results in many of the sessions having some kind of bias or marketing twist. This unsurprising as the speakers are often incentivized to do so and without such sponsorship most conferences would not exist, but it is necessary to remain cognizant of this facet when sitting in a session whose speakers claims are on par with claiming to have invented a better mouse trap.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I get back from a conference and decompress, I find myself thinking, &#8220;Wait, this only works in that specific instance? How is that even helpful?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-left' data-pullquote='Once the honeymoon period ends on some of these new things, it becomes apparent that instead of sliced bread, they&#8217;re just the same old bread repackaged in a shiny shell.'>
Once the honeymoon period ends on some of these new things, it becomes apparent that instead of sliced bread, they&#8217;re just the same old bread repackaged in a shiny shell. On the other hand, even the discovery that some of the newfangled technologies offer little benefits over tried and true methods can itself be a significant benefit.
</span></p>

<p>Further, while every new thing cannot itself be directly applicable and useful, each new thing that a developer learns is yet another thing they can add to their arsenal. Then sometime in the future, they will have the knowledge of how a problem was once solved and whether it would be useful in a given set of circumstances. So while it will not all bear fruit, gaining knowledge from a conference, as it does in any realm, serves to enrich the developer&#8217;s background for future endeavors.</p>

<p>If you are attending <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation 2012</a>, I hope to see you there!</p>

<p><a id="excitement1"></a>[1] I would <em>love</em> to attend DrupalCon this year, but the timing and travel just didn&#8217;t work out. Thankfully, <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation</a> is being held right in my backyard!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is one of those tips that seems almost too easy to be true.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://victorquinn.com/files/VQResumeLatest.pdf">resume</a> and cover letters are written in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. LaTeX is a typesetting system often used for creating technical documents as it is particularly good at creating complex documents including scientific equations. I have been using it for a few years to draft documents both because it gives me a lot of control over the output and so that I could prepare myself for working with technical documents such as patents which are likely be written in LaTeX.</p>

<p>I wanted to include my signature in a cover letter. In order to do so in LaTeX, it required a graphic in <em>.eps</em> format. However, my signature was a <em>.png</em> image. I searched for awhile until I came across the answer which was so simple I felt silly for not knowing it.</p>

<p>I thought it may prove useful to someone else. This is a command line trick, so if you are not familiar with a terminal, this tip will not be of much help. Without further adieu:</p>

<p>Simply use the <em>convert</em> command line utility to convert it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Convert Command</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>convert image.png image.eps
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yes, it was that easy! Out came a perfect .eps file which I was able to use in my LaTeX document. The <a href="http://man.cx/convert"><em>convert</em></a> command has all sorts of other options for resizing and many other things, but for simply doing a straight conversion, that was all!</p>

<p>Worth noting, while this worked for <em>.png</em> to <em>.eps</em>, it also works for <em>.jpg</em> to <em>.eps</em> and <em>.gif</em> to <em>.eps</em>. Have not tested anything else, but it appears to be pretty versatile!</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
