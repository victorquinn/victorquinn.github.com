  <div class="entry-content"><p>In early September 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit came down with a controversial decision in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/10/09-35969.pdf" target="_blank">Vernor v. Autodesk</a>. In this case, Vernor had purchased used copies of Autodesk&#8217;s software, AutoCAD and sold them on eBay. Autodesk attempted to bar him from selling them, claiming essentially that their initial sale of the software was a license to use the software and not the sale of the physical disk and therefore that he could not resell it.</p>
<p>In making this argument, Autodesk attempted to get around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine" target="_blank">first-sale doctrine</a> which would preclude them from intervening. The first-sale doctrine, at its essence, says that once something (such as a painting) has been sold, the artist has no claim to profits, etc. in future sales. Vernor attempted to use this first-sale doctrine as a defense claiming the resale of software was no different from the resale of a painting in which the original creator no longer has any claim. Vernor claims the physical item which was sold was the disk and he should be free to resell at will.</p>
<p>However, Autodesk argued that the disk simply contained the program and it was subject to a license. Essentially, the original purchaser paid Autodesk not for the physical disk, but for the right to use what was contained therein.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the court sided with Autodesk in this case, thereby barring Vernor and other third-parties from reselling software granted by license without the approval of the original vendor.</p>
<p>I think this brings up a few interesting points. First, it questions the nature of software. Is it a physical item, or is it a license to use that item? If it is a physical item, then clearly the first-sale doctrine ought apply. If it is a license to use that item, then it would make sense for a reseller to have issues reselling for they will be unable to sell a license that was essentially a contract for use between Autodesk and the original purchaser. The transfer of the physical disk ceases to matter.</p>
<p>This offends many people&#8217;s notions of what software is/ought to be. Many people expect to purchase software and have it be theirs to do with as they would please in perpetuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us look at things from the standpoint of the software company. Let&#8217;s say they have a piece of software that is one-time use. Autodesk is not, but we will assume this for the sake of the following hypothetical. Assume the software will calculate some thing once, then will no longer have use. In a world where the software can be resold, the company that created the software is going to set their price based on this assumption that people will resell it. So they will charge a high enough value to cover their expenses to offset the second sale of that software for which they will get no profits.</p>
<p>To put it more concretely, I offer the following example. Imagine a software company spent $100,000 on a piece of software and thinks they will have 10,000 users. If they want to make their money back, they should sell the software for $10. However, if half of those users (5,000) purchase the software from the company at that rate and resell it for $8 after they have made use of it, the software company has spent $100,000 to create the software and only recouped $50,000 from sales. Further, these first users are only paying $2 to use the software. So the software company is going to realize a huge loss.</p>
<p>The company could certainly attempt to account for resale when setting their prices. Knowing that only half will purchase the software from them directly, they could sell it for $20 thereby making their $100,000 back on the half (5,000) that buy it. However, this is a tricky thing to do. Maybe when they sell it for $20, only 1/4 purchase the software and the remaining 3/4 get it used because the initial cost is too high. Now the creator is getting $20 for 2,500 licenses or $50,000, again taking a loss.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point for this hypothetical is that things are extremely unpredictable when things are set up in this manner, such that the first sale doctrine applies. However, if we treat software as a license instead of applying the first-sale doctrine, much of the unpredictability goes away. If it cost $100,000 to create the software, they can sell it for $10/license. It is then far easier for the software company to price the item such that they will recoup their development costs. Further, it removes the incentive to be a middle man which existed with resale. With resale, it made sense for many entities to purchase the software from the company, use it, then resell it. Then they have gotten extremely cheap use of the software. One could argue that allowing resale is more consumer friendly, and this I do not dispute, but in order for the consumer to benefit in this manner (by having extremely low-cost use of software) there is a reciprocal deficit borne by the software companies.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that the <strong>paradigm of the first-sale doctrine breaks down when dealing with virtual items.</strong> When things can be infinitely copied without penalty as is the case with digital items, things get messy fast.</p>
<p>I think, going forward, we need to pick one road or the other. I think it is starting to make more sense to make the first-sale doctrine no longer apply to software. As we move more toward a digital age, the antiquated notion of software as a physical item needs to go away. I am glad the court is moving in this direction. Technology is moving at such a fast pace that the law is struggling to keep up. This is one of those realms and it is exciting when the law catches up.</p>
<p>First-sale doctrine issues aside, I think this is ultimately a question of intellectual property. I think that since Autodesk created the software, they ought to have the final say in how it is used. I like the fact that software uses a license model with many modern devices. Due to this, I can purchase an app on my iPod Touch and I can also use it on my iPad without having to purchase it again. If I threw my iPod Touch in the river and replaced it with a new one, I could re-download that app without having to buy it again. This is due to the flexibility of the license model which Apple has applied to its App Store. Since I have paid for a license to use the software, I do not need to pay again to retrieve another copy. Certainly I lose the freedom to be able to pass that app to my friend, but I would take that over the alternative of having to buy another copy every time the device on which it&#8217;s running breaks or otherwise loses the software.</p>
<p>This model could also be more clear to the consumer. If the only legitimate way to purchase some software is from the creator, people will be less bombarded with disreputable sources. Try a <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=purchase+windows+7" target="_blank">search for where to purchase Windows 7.</a>&nbsp;The user is bombarded with ads for PriceGrabber.com and RealBuySoftware.com and other questionably legitimate sources*. &nbsp;Compare this to something like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8">Angry Birds</a>, where it can be purchased in the Apple app store, the Android app store, and that&#8217;s about it. A Google search does not bombard anyone with links of third party retailers trying to resell the software because Angry Birds is sold on a license basis and therefore cannot be resold.</p>
<p>I also think the free market will handle the dissenters of such a system. If people have a dislike for licensed software, they can buy from another software creator who will sell theirs as a physical item. Or, depending on their needs, open source is always a great option and they can forego payment altogether. (though they should support open source projects via donations, etc. if they are financially capable!)</p>
<p>Overall I think, like an artist who creates a painting, a software company should be able to dictate who does what with their intellectual property. An artist can give reproduction rights to one entity and charge another to show their painting in a gallery. They have that say unless or until they part with the painting by selling it. I think the same ought to apply to software. <strong>If a company wants to license their software, but retain the rights to reproduction, etc. that should be their choice to make. </strong></p>
<p>For this reason and the others stated above, I think the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals made the right decision in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I have no clue whether or not these sources are legitimate and I am not assuming they are illegitimate by using them as examples; I have never heard of them and they could just as well be replaced by stolensoftware.com or some other equally questionable site. With the ability for multiple vendors to carry both unused copies and resale copies of software, there is a very high signal to noise ratio which is likely confusing to the lay consumer.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started this blog, I decided I would try to write multiple times per week. It was easy at first because I had a ton of things I wanted to stand on my soapbox and rant to the world.&nbsp;It was interesting, but I soon went from rapid posting to saying barely a word in almost 2 months. This is not because I did not have time* or because I have run out of things to say, it is because I have been trying hard to figure out my audience and write appropriately.</p>
<p>I started this blog mostly ranting about some aimless ideological things which I encountered in the world and, as much as I find value in those posts, I found myself becoming disillusioned with the direction in which I was headed. I could continue writing things like that forever, but while I think they are useful tidbits, they are of limited utility. I wanted more from myself.</p>
<p>So I started looking at my life and my interests and decided I would write some more meaningful, substantive content and add value to current discussions/issues in the world. I thought that would have far more value than my aimless rants inspired by my everyday life. This also fit more with my idea of the purpose this blog should serve.</p>
<p>So, I sat down to write my first substantive piece&#8230;and I wrote&#8230;and wrote&#8230;and wrote&#8230;</p>
<p>I ran into the opposite problem of writer&#8217;s block. Instead of not having anything about which to write, I would not stop finding things to write. I felt like Grady Tripp from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boys">Wonder Boys</a> with his ever growing manuscript. He got so lost in the details, he was not writing anything of value.</p>
<p>In my case, I was writing about a copyright decision which occurred in early September that I found interesting (<a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/10/09-35969.pdf" target="_blank">Vernor v. AutoDesk</a>) and felt I had something to add to the conversation. And here is where I failed - I did not really know my audience. In discussing the case, I kept going on tangents essentially writing a treatise on copyright law, trying to explain every little nuance and nitty gritty detail.</p>
<p>There were two key issues with this. First, it is wasteful and silly for me to take up so much space on my blog discussing things which many other people have come along and explained quite well before me. Second, and more importantly, it was a failure on my part to know my audience. See the thing is that I do not really know my audience. I just set this up one day and started writing. I did not tell my friends or family or basically anyone that it was here. Anyone looking for me could probably find it, but I did not alert anyone of its presence. In not knowing who is out there reading this, it was difficult to appropriately target them with my writing. So I tried to write to target anyone with a pulse.</p>
<p>So, here I was with a pretty good idea botching it entirely on execution. I knew I was floundering and things were going too far so I scrapped that post. I started again with some other such interesting topic. And I did the same thing again. In my attempt to package it such that anyone could follow along, my writing quickly became dry, boring, and extremely lengthy as I tried to explain base concepts. This failure to know my audience and write to the appropriate level again doomed me because I kept thinking, &#8220;maybe I should explain this&#8221; and &#8220;maybe they do not know that&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly I believe it is somewhat pointless to write at such a level that no one can understand what is going on and it takes one skilled in the art to parse it. On the other hand, it is also wasteful to attempt to explain everything in such gory detail that a child could comprehend but that no one would ever read due to its prolixity.</p>
<p>I consider this is a valuable lesson to have learned. <strong>Know your audience.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Further, I realized that <strong>in my attempt to satisfy any given reader, I was ultimately satisfying <em>no one.</em></strong>&nbsp;This is an extremely important lesson.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">With that said, I will attempt to go down the path of writing my substantive tidbits and hopefully having more frequent updates, but I will target an audience that is capable, intelligent, curious, but not skilled in the art. I will write as though I were talking to some of my close friends that fit this description. By doing so, I will be able to write fluid, pointed substance which I would enjoy reading if I were to come upon it. If you do not fall into that category, I apologize, but there are many other blogs out there that may better satisfy your needs.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">* T</span></strong>he fallacy of the &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do X&#8221; argument will have its own post at a later date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often I see people who second guess past decisions and spend a great amount of time beating themselves up about them.&nbsp;What they need to realize is that once some decisions are made, they cannot be unmade, much like an egg cannot be un-fried.</p>
<p>While self-analysis is certainly useful in order to learn about oneself and the motives behind past decisions in order to inform future decisions, there are instances in which a decision has been made, for better or for worse, and no amount of dwelling on the past will change it or its results. The important thing is being able to differentiate between the situations where there is a lesson to learn and those where there is not. Once that lesson is learned, move on and try to make the best of the situation.</p>
<p>Most people need help coming to the realization that they cannot change the past and that they must focus on the future, or risk making more bad decisions whilst dwelling on this past poor one. It is difficult to let go of a bad decision, and often this dwelling is an attempt to maintain control over an otherwise out of control situation.</p>
<p>I am confident that everyone has done this and will continue to do it in the future. Personally, I used to do this all the time. Over time, as I grew older and started making more major decisions, I realized that this was a colossal waste of time, one which often ended in more poor choices as I spent more time thinking about past decisions than I did focusing on making good future ones.</p>
<p>The next time you find yourself in a position where you are second guessing a past decision, take a moment to step back, take an objective view at the landscape, and decide whether your fretting is productive in any way. Often you will find it is not. Move on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many things which are inefficient in the world. I am constantly looking for ways to optimize everyday things in order to make things more efficient in order to reduce wasteful efforts and allow people to spend more time focusing on that which is really important in their lives. I like to split these things into two separate categories, <strong>micro-efficiency</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>macro-efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p />
<div>The reason I split these into two categories is that I see them as fundamentally different challenges which can be generalized in much the same manner as economics. In that field, micro-economics is the study of localized things such as one&#8217;s own personal finances whereas macro-economics is the study of economic issues at a global scale. These two, though related, are quite different from one another in analysis and method.</div>
<p />
<div>I have many theories, ideas, etc. on an everyday basis about macro-efficiency, however I will not discuss that in this post. This post will focus on micro-efficiency.<br />
<p />
<div>One thing that I constantly see is some iteration of the following. I am walking with someone to their car, or their apartment and they wait until they get to their door then they decide to go and pull out their keys while we are standing there at the locked entryway, unable to enter until they finish rummaging through their purse or pocket. The same happens when walking to a car or any other such locked device. And, as far as I have seen, most people seem to exhibit this behavior.</div>
<div>And, most people seem to think nothing of it, but to me it is jarring. Why not pull the keys out while you are walking? It takes no more effort to reach into your pocket 30 seconds earlier and do the same process. My suspicion is that most people do not notice/care. Their brains think, &#8220;walk to the car, walk to the car&#8221; and when they get there, they think &#8220;get out your keys, get out your keys&#8221;. They do not seem to think &#8220;walk to the car, car requires keys for entry, let me get out my keys so they are ready for allowing us to get into the car&#8221;. The former is something I do not seem to understand, our brains are capable of much more than simple serial instructions. There is no extra time or effort expended in someone reaching for their keys whilst walking to their car, they just decided to use their brains and start the action a bit sooner.</div>
<p />
<div>Certainly, most people would brush this off as trivial and call me a nitpicking idiot. I have no illusions about this. However, it just doesn&#8217;t seem to make any sense to me. I think of how most people probably do this every time they get to their car or to the locked door of their home and how they &#8220;waste&#8221; 10 seconds every time. I think of how most people do this multiple times per day, let&#8217;s say at least three (going out to car in the morning, getting back into car after work, opening the door at home), often more. That&#8217;s 3.5 minutes per week, a little over 3 hours per year, and ~10 days over the course of the average lifetime. In the U.S. alone, if half the population does this, it equates to a bit more than 513&nbsp;centuries wasted per year.</div>
<p />
<div>This may not sound like much on a per-person basis, but this is just one of many needlessly time-wasting behaviors in which people regularly engage. How often do you see someone at the grocery store checkout line who waits to hear what the total is before they start digging through their purse for their wallet, then look for their card, then say, &#8220;oh yeah, i have this coupon&#8221; instead of having their card out and ready as they know payment is imminent. Or go to a vending machine and do the same thing, instead of pulling out their wallet, getting the dollar ready on their way there and having it ready to insert as soon as they get there?</div>
<p />
<div>Now, certainly some would argue that there is just cause for taking longer to do some things, particularly if one is on the clock and are paid whether they are doing work or standing at the vending machine making a choice, but for things such as their car keys, it adds up quickly. It could also be argued that time spent standing outside your car by yourself affords more time for self-reflexitivity. While a decent argument, let&#8217;s be serious, who honestly spends that extra time doing anything productive?</div>
<p />
<div>And this does not just have an effect over the span of someone&#8217;s lifetime. If someone is running late for a meeting, some seconds spent rummaging through their purse while standing still at their car, which could have been done at the same time as they walked toward it, could make a significant difference.</div>
<p />
<div>My main point in all of this is not that everyone truly needs to save 30 seconds per day, but why is it that most people waste 30 seconds per day needlessly? We as humans are endowed with a wonderfully capable computing device which can allow us to do some incredible things. Why not put it to use so we can save those extra moments to witness things that actually matter to us. Those 30 seconds wasted on fumbling for keys from leaving home to getting back from work may be all one needs to catch their child&#8217;s first steps.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>This type of micro-efficiency, when applied to many everyday tasks, could quickly add up to saving significant, non-trivial amounts of time, otherwise needlessly wasted and all it takes is a little extra thought and attention to detail.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://vaporstun.com/files/duckduckgo-safari-extension/DuckDuckGoBar.safariextz">Download</a></p>
<p>This is another mostly style update for the DuckDuckGo Safari Extension. First, a screenshot of Version 1.2:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://victorquinn.com/images/duckduckgobar1.png" title="DuckDuckGoBar v 1.2" ></p>
<p>The first thing I did was switch from the square DDG icon to the new round one. I do my best to stay current and in sync with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=victorquinn">DuckDuckGo</a> and a favicon update there dictates one here.</p>
<p>I also made some other style changes to match up with them a bit better. The previous versions of the bar had rounded edges because that is the way Apple differentiates between the URL and the Search bar. If you look at Safari on the desktop or on any iOS device, you will notice that the URL has squared off edges whereas the search box has very rounded edges. This is an easy way for the user to differentiate. However, since the DuckDuckGo search cannot go in the top, I decided to opt for something that more closely matches the DuckDuckGo search rather than the built in Safari search. Again, many would argue this is excessive attention to detail, but I wanted it to be perfect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also replaced the regular search button that said &#8220;DuckDuckGo!&#8221; with a more professional looking image search button using the same image that DuckDuckGo uses. This gives further consistency and looks quite a bit nicer in my opinion.</p>
<p>And last, since I removed DuckDuckGo! text from the search button, I still wanted it to say the name somewhere. So I pre-populate the textfield with that text in a light grey. I make it disappear when focus is granted to the textfield and also return the textfield to a normal color so the search terms stand out.</p>
<p>I also ensured that the search bar looked alright in Windows. Previously, I had developed it on a Mac so I did not see how poorly it looked on Windows. With this update, I made sure to make it look equally nice and pixel perfect on Safari for Windows.</p>
<p>The new look:</p>
<p><img class="center" src="http://victorquinn.com/images/duckduckgobar2.png" title="DuckDuckGoBar v 1.3" ></p>
<p>The extension is now listed on Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://extensions.apple.com/#search-tools">Safari Extension Gallery</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is common that people wish they could just stop working. When someone is confronted with the &#8220;what would you do if you had a million dollars&#8221; question, most people assume they will stop working and try to find something extravagant/outlandish. But would they really want to stop doing everything and just lay around? I&#8217;d be willing to bet nearly anything that anyone who does nothing but lay around will quickly get bored. I think the concept of doing nothing is a backlash against being &#8220;forced&#8221; into doing things they do not want to do in order to pay their bills.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:YshQTH4dp5fiGbRat002]]</p>
<p>And of course, a bit of it is that when someone goes &#8220;on vacation&#8221;, they frequently pay through the nose for good experiences, eat out all of the time, etc. This further makes the concept of vacation so alluring, because most people do not behave this way in their everyday life, so not only is vacation a chance to get away from their work, it is also an excuse to open their wallets. A million dollars would not last long if spent in this manner, so the common answer to what most people would do is not really reasonable. In actuality, they may have enough to literally sit around and live off of the interest, but that&#8217;s about it. And, while sitting in your sweatpants watching TV is great for a short while, it will quickly grow old. <p /> When most people take vacations, they are great because they are a break from the doldrums of everyday life. However, without something to take a break from, not working loses a lot of its allure. When you have slaved for awhile, the feeling of exultation upon leaving said bondage is immeasurable. On the other hand, if you have been sitting around all day and you decide you &#8220;need a break&#8221; from sitting around, that break will be far less enticing. Like a piece of bread to a starving man, it is the differential, the hunger, which gives the bread such an amazing taste.</p>
<p>In my life, I always try to work hard, not only in my job, but in other things in life. I work harder than most people because I constantly seek to better myself. Whether it be a job skill or something mundane like a Rubik&#8217;s cube (yes, I can solve one, and quickly), I always see room for improvement.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:bCxdbJDfltAxvrsGcAlb]]</p>
<p>I was told once that I am &#8220;good at everything I try.&#8221; I say this not to flaunt my abilities, but rather to point out that it is not through random happenstance that I am good at many things. It is through consistent, hard work improving these, often otherwise useless, abilities. Outside observers look at me and see someone who just magically seems to excel at things. What they don&#8217;t see is the many hours spent late at night perfecting those skills. <p /> It is from this hard work and determination that I get such an intense joy when I get a break from my everyday routine. When I am away and spend the time solely on my enjoyment of life and the world, it is quite refreshing. But I truly believe that if I did not work as hard as I do at most things, most of the allure of a vacation would be lost. Even just taking a few days off to relax around the house was amazing. If I had every day off to sit around my house and relax, I doubt I would appreciate it as much as I do when I&#8217;m working hard. <p /> Back to the million dollars question, if I had a million dollars, I could not count the things I would try to do and nearly all of them most others would consider work. I want to create, I want to make great things that can change the world or otherwise impact people, I want to get others to look at the world from a different perspective and change their priorities. I want to make people realize what is important in life and how amazing it all is if you take the time to appreciate it. There is so much I want to do and none of it will get done if I spend my days sitting on my couch in my sweatpants watching TV.</p>
<p><br />I do not desire an infinite lifetime of doing nothing, in fact that sounds like a kind of torture to me. So, when I do take a break, I like to do it in style because I know I have earned it. Work hard, Play hard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com?t=victorquinn" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo.com</a> is a great search engine alternative to Google. I first read about it on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">HackerNews</a>, and was intrigued. In a nutshell, I love DuckDuckGo&#8217;s approach to privacy, offering searches over a secure channel and the way they do not cache any search history. I also like their interface and the zero-click info is fantastic, often saving me a trip to Wikipedia to parse through an entire article. Never having to page through search results was at first just neat, now when I occasionally use Google, I am annoyed because clicking the &#8220;Next&#8221; button seems antiquated. And my favorite feature, as a developer, is the bang syntax. Adding something like !php at the beginning of my search query automatically does the search on php&#8217;s website. Likewise for many other things I use on a regular basis like !drupalapi. Overall, I have grown to love it and use it as my primary search.</p>
<p>But this post is not meant to be solely about evangelizing DuckDuckGo (though I&#8217;m quite happy to do so!).&nbsp;At first, I tried using it as my primary search, but always went back to Google because there wasn&#8217;t really a good way to set it as the search default in Safari, my browser of choice. There is a Safari plugin called Glims which allows for adding DuckDuckGo as a search engine but in my experience I found it to be a bit buggy. As a web developer, I simply cannot get my work done with a buggy browser.&nbsp;So, this prevented me from using DuckDuckGo on an everyday basis. Until Safari Extensions came along.</p>
<p>Safari recently added extensions to the latest version of their web browser. And they are based entirely on web standards. And I am a web developer. And I&#8217;ve been wanting a way to add DuckDuckGo to Safari&#8230;</p>
<p>Taking the obvious path, I decided to write such an extension. I first tried to add DuckDuckGo to the existing Safari search widget. Turns out this is one of the things to which Safari Extension Developers do not have access. So, I went with the next best thing, creating a simple bar which had a DuckDuckGo search in it. This way, it will always be there ready for searching and I will actually use it.</p>
<p>I decided right off the bat to add a couple of features that make it (in my opinion) more useful than the default search. First, is the option to open a new search: in the current tab, in a background tab, in a new tab, or in a new window. This is configurable so the user can do whatever they want to suit their preferences. This is not possible in Safari&#8217;s default search. I also added a context menu search with the same options (but is separately configurable, so if you like searches in the bar to open in the same tab, but searches via the right-click menu to open in a new tab, that is possible). So, with the context menu search, in Safari, you can highlight any text, right click, and see a menu item to perform that search. I also added the option to perform the search via SSL. As mentioned above with the privacy issues, one feature that is nice with DuckDuckGo is the ability to search with SSL Encryption. So it is on by default, but there is an option in the extension so users can turn it off if they want to do plain, not secure searches.</p>
<p>I have had a few requests from users, the first was to add a shortcut to the extension to jump to the search field. Now, press Ctrl-d to jump to the search bar. I chose Ctrl-d because I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else it was used for and it seemed to make sense. D for Duck!</p>
<p>I also had a request to remove focus when performing a search. When I tested and use the extension, I prefer to have my searches open in a new tab. So I did not catch a small bug which occurred when opening a search in the current tab. The issue is that the search bar continues to have focus, so keyboard shortcuts do not work. So I added a small change to remove focus from the search bar once the search has been performed.</p>
<p>Another request was to reduce the size of the bar. Extension bars&nbsp;in Safari take up a static amount of space, so I sought to maximize the amount of space used by the bar. I also like to have a nice big font so it&#8217;s easier on the eyes. So I made the search box as large as possible while still staying in the bar. It looked pixel perfect on both of my Macs and my fiance&#8217;s laptop, so I thought everything was good to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="center" src="http://victorquinn.com/images/duckduckgobar1.png" title="DuckDuckGoBar v. 1.2" ></p>
<p>Well, apparently it is not perfect on everyone&#8217;s machine and there were a couple of requests to reduce it&#8217;s size. So, I did just that in the latest version which I put live a few minutes ago. I also updated the DuckDuckGo favicon to the newest version. It now looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="center" src="http://victorquinn.com/images/duckduckgobar2.png" title="DuckDuckGoBar v. 1.3" ></p>
<p>While this is more explanation than anyone probably needs about an extremely rudimentary Safari Extension, I thought it worthwhile to document my progress, and who knows, someone may find something I&#8217;ve said interesting or useful.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing, this project is currently open-source and <a href="http://github.com/vaporstun/duckduckgo-safari-extension">hosted on github</a>, so if anyone wants to tweak/modify it or make other improvements, go for it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was playing a silly game on my cell phone the other day and, for a bit, it was pretty frustrating. But I kept retrying the level that was giving me trouble until I mastered the technique and moved beyond it. It gave me pause and made me think about how many people would react to such a situation.</p>
<p />
<div>Many people would&nbsp;quickly give up and blame the game. They&#8217;d say, &#8220;this game is too hard&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not a game of skill, it&#8217;s a game of luck&#8221; or &#8220;the controls for this game are crappy&#8221;. They may immediately look online for someone else&#8217;s solution or cheat codes because they do not want to figure it out for themselves. This happens&nbsp;all the time in&nbsp;other games as well, in tennis, players blame their racket or the net, in golf, people blame the clubs or the wind or what they had for lunch or their pants. While these things can certainly be factors contributing to their failures,&nbsp;rarely does one blame themselves and decide they have to practice harder or improve a certain aspect of their play. It is far easier to blame the game than to blame themselves.</div>
<p />
<div>And this moves beyond games into the realm of reality. Many people blame delays in projects at work on other people, they blame traffic if they arrive late. Seldom does someone take responsibility for their actions and say, &#8220;the project is late because I had difficulty prioritizing things&#8221; or &#8220;I arrived late because I did not allot enough time for travel&#8221;. It is quick and easy to pass the blame off on an inanimate object or something which is out of a person&#8217;s control because then it seems to most people that &#8220;it could not be helped&#8221;.</div>
<p />
<div>It is difficult to avoid the blame game and admit fault when something does not go as planned. Often there could be consequences if something, such as a project at work, is late due to something fully within the employee&#8217;s control. So they pass the blame off to some nebulous, unexplained nothing in the clouds so it is no longer within their control and they do not fear disciplinary action as a result. Part of this is the fault of the employee for passing blame instead of taking responsibility for their actions, but part of it is also the fault of the employer for their reaction to misplaced blame and how they would react if the employee were perfectly honest with them. Personally, if I were an employer, I would much rather my employee tell me she was late because she needed to sleep in a bit than passing the blame off to something, or someone else. However, it seems to me that this is not the way most employers would react.</div>
<p />
<div>Now, I do not intend to generalize and assume that every time some project is late or there is some error it is within the control of the person affected by it, in fact often things truly are completely out of someone&#8217;s control. The key there is recognizing those moments and differentiating them from aimless blame transference. Transferring blame is a great way not only to avoid any responsibility but also to never learn, adapt, and grow. If I blame my tardiness on traffic, then I will not change my behavior because traffic is out of my control. If however I realize that it was my failure to allot ample time for my travel, then I can adjust accordingly and arrive in a timely fashion, even if traffic intervenes.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>If everyone took a little time to be self-analyzing and note where they usually place blame, they will likely notice that it is seldom merited and that they can improve themselves greatly by righting the behaviors that lead to those issues.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Don&#8217;t play the blame game, it is a game where everybody loses, no one improves, and dishonesty takes precedence.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I have never really understood about people is their predisposition to telling tales of misery. Why is this? Why don&#8217;t most people want to share tales of joy?</p>

<p>To illustrate, I will give a couple of examples.</p>

<p>If two people are standing by the water cooler and one bitches about how his wife made him take out the trash, the other can bitch about how his wife made him fix the plumbing. Both employees have shared their crappy story and feel a sense of bonding with the other. In their shared misery, they have found a common ground.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that scenario playing out as follows, two people standing by the water cooler. One comes up and tells the other about how he worked hard, did some other work on the side and saved money and went on an awesome trip for his birthday with his wife who made him an awesome birthday dinner, and they had great adventures followed by incredible sex for hours. The other person will likely feel awkward and want to sneak away. This is not a generally socially acceptable story.</p>

<p>But why is this the reaction? It would seem as though people would want to hear good things about others and it would fill them with joy as well. However, there is something else at play there.&nbsp;My best guess is that it comes to an odd social rule, fueled primarily by envy. When one person tells the story of something awesome, the other has a feeling of envy. He feels sad that he has not earned such a trip and that his wife did not do all of that awesome stuff for him last weekend, he does not have a relatable story, so the two employees do not connect. He secretly wishes he had some similar story of awesome, but instead of trying himself to work hard to earn it as his colleague has, he gives up, resolving that his situation is different from the other employee&#8217;s and that his life is different. Thus a rift is created between the two instead of a common bonding point.</p>

<p>Most people like to complain, they complain about their wives, their crappy situations, etc. And when someone shares a story of joy or something they have earned, it is frowned upon as gloating. My question is: <em>When did people stop being proud of their achievements and begin suppressing them?</em> That seems like madness to me.</p>

<p>When someone tells me a story of something awesome that has happened to them as a result of their work, effort, or wisdom, instead of being filled with discomfort or envy, it fills me with nothing but passion and a desire to work harder such that I may achieve equivalent or better things. It seems to me this is the way everyone should behave for it fosters a race to the top instead of a race to the bottom with everyone striving to achieve more instead of everyone striving to have a miserable life so they can have relatable stories.</p>

<p>Further, hearing a happy, excited tale gets me happy and excited whereas hearing a depressing tale gets me depressed. In my view, anyone who wishes that others suppress their tales of joy and instead tell tales of sorrow is jealous and unable to achieve greatness themselves. This may be a narrow viewpoint but I see no other logical reason for such behavior. While I do not intend to change people and this attribute of their behavior, I do intend to surround myself with people who are willing and able to achieve greatness and do not shy away from stories of great things they or others around them have earned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have blogged before, but this is the first time I am creating a blog with my own name and will use it for general purpose blogging. In the past, I had one tech blog, a separate blog for my musings about politics, etc. It occurred to me that some people would get use out of all of those things and there was no need to have them all separate. This also rids me of the need to maintain a few different blogs when a single one will suffice.</p>

<p>Additionally, I previously had different URLs/names/identities for each of these blogs which were all anonymous and had no link to myself. I had nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, and did not need to hide under a shroud of anonymity for fear that anyone would find out who I was. So why did I do this? In the past, everyone strove to be anonymous online. However, with things changing as they are, more and more people are moving toward using their own, true identity online. I see no reason why I should not also use my true identity in an online forum.</p>

<p>So this is it, the start of a journey. The start of a journey is always one of my favorite concepts. Every time I have started a journey, I have been there with bags packed and rough idea of where I want to go. One of my favorite moments is when I have passed the airport security, am waiting for my plane, and sit at the bar to have a beer. I am full of anticipation knowing what the near future will have in store for me. I may have hostels or rail tickets booked, but it is impossible to envision everything that will happen along the way on that journey. I may decide at some point to stop off and see something I had not planned on seeing that could change my outlook on life. I know that at least for the next few days, weeks, months, I will do nothing but adventure, explore, and take it all in. Sitting there, I am full of anticipation because, although I do not know everything that will happen on the journey, I do know that I will be out there and it is a great break from the monotony of everyday life.</p>

<p>That is the way I feel right now as I write this first post and start a journey on this blog. I have an idea of what I intend to discuss, but beyond that I&#8217;ll see where the wind takes me.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
