<div class="entry-content"><p>I often have random ideas which occupy my mind which are seldom written down anywhere. I have decided that I will start documenting these random ideas on this website, starting with one that has been percolating for some time. As a warning, most of these ideas are half-baked and often I have done little to no research into whether they are actually viable, already patented, or otherwise developed. They are just my raw thoughts for things I think would be neat or useful to society if implemented. It just seems as though they are squandered occupying my brain for awhile then fading away, unremembered.</p>
<p>My first of these random ideas is a generator powered by waste material in high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>We spend a fair amount of resources to get items up into high-rise buildings. From water for showers, the toilet, or cooking to groceries and other household items, there is energy expended to get these items up to the top of a tall building. Then, there are waste pipes or garbage chutes which just let the items fall back to earth, wasting the energy expended to get those objects up into the building. Surely something can be done to harness this energy!</p>
<p>So my concept is to have some kind of generator powered by waste from high-rise buildings. This may take many forms. First, from waste-water. Right now, the waste-water enters the pipes and falls by gravity down to the ground floor where it goes into the sewers. This falling is just wasted potential energy. Why not put a turbine driven by the falling water in the path to recoup some of that wasted energy?&nbsp;Better yet, why not a handful of these turbines along the path of the water? Water, much like air, has a terminal velocity, a maximum speed attained in free-fall limited by friction by outside forces. In a free-falling body, it is the friction of air which limits the speed of descent. With water in pipes, it is not only the friction of air in the pipes, but also likely the friction of the wall of the pipe as well. So putting small turbine generators at different intervals along the high-rise building will harness the maximum amount of energy without losing it to such friction.</p>
<p>Next, there is the trash. From bottles and cans to cardboard and other packaging to food waste, there is a fair amount of stuff which is hauled up by residents and then discarded. Many buildings have some sort of garbage chute where trash just kind of falls down to the place where it is to be handled. Why not have some system to harness the energy related to that item falling back to the ground level? One such implementation could be a sort of reverse dumbwaiter where refuse is loaded and as it makes its descent to the ground level, the motion is turning a generator.</p>
<p>Now certainly any such method as described above will not generate more power than was used to get those objects up into the high-rise building in the first place, but at least they could help recoup some of that energy and not have it entirely wasted. By doing so, the energy cost in moving those objects up in the building would be significantly lessened.</p>
<p>Think about a 12-pack of bottled beer. Currently, a resident of a high-rise building goes to the store and buys it, then carries it in the elevator with them. Energy is expended to get that elevator up in the building to the resident&#8217;s floor. Then they drink the beer. They urinate and that waste just falls down the pipes. Then they discard the used bottles into the garbage chute where they fall aimlessly. In my proposed system, some of that waste water would be used to power turbines and the weight of those bottles falling to generate some energy. While the energy gained from any one resident&#8217;s waste-water or trash would not amount to much, all of the energy generated from the waste of the many hundreds or thousands of residents in a tall building would likely be non-trivial. And simply unharnessed at present for anything. By making this a bit more efficient, we burn a bit less oil or coal or gas which can pollute the environment and could be put to better use.</p>
<p>Tangentially related, there could be a rainwater collector at the top of such a high-rise which runs a turbine as it makes its descent to the ground. Since we made no effort to carry the rain up to such a height, that is just extra energy.</p>
<p>This concept also need not require a high-rise building per se. Similar systems could be installed in low-rise buildings, though their return would be less. Economically, it may not be worth it or feasible to install these in low-rise buildings if the energy they recoup is less than the energy or other resources required to keep such systems repaired and in working order. There is a non-trivial cost in installation, maintenance, etc. and if that cost is not at least offset by the savings, then these systems would not be worthwhile to install.</p>
<p>Certainly it would not be possible to power any particular appliances or devices directly by any of these methods, but the power could be stored in batteries and used at some other point or contributed back to the grid thereby causing some powerplant somewhere to burn a bit less fuel than it may have otherwise. If these were in every skyscraper in a city, they would have a non-trivial contribution.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
