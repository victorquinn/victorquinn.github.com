<div class="entry-content"><p>When I started this blog, I decided I would try to write multiple times per week. It was easy at first because I had a ton of things I wanted to stand on my soapbox and rant to the world.&nbsp;It was interesting, but I soon went from rapid posting to saying barely a word in almost 2 months. This is not because I did not have time* or because I have run out of things to say, it is because I have been trying hard to figure out my audience and write appropriately.</p>
<p>I started this blog mostly ranting about some aimless ideological things which I encountered in the world and, as much as I find value in those posts, I found myself becoming disillusioned with the direction in which I was headed. I could continue writing things like that forever, but while I think they are useful tidbits, they are of limited utility. I wanted more from myself.</p>
<p>So I started looking at my life and my interests and decided I would write some more meaningful, substantive content and add value to current discussions/issues in the world. I thought that would have far more value than my aimless rants inspired by my everyday life. This also fit more with my idea of the purpose this blog should serve.</p>
<p>So, I sat down to write my first substantive piece&#8230;and I wrote&#8230;and wrote&#8230;and wrote&#8230;</p>
<p>I ran into the opposite problem of writer&#8217;s block. Instead of not having anything about which to write, I would not stop finding things to write. I felt like Grady Tripp from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boys">Wonder Boys</a> with his ever growing manuscript. He got so lost in the details, he was not writing anything of value.</p>
<p>In my case, I was writing about a copyright decision which occurred in early September that I found interesting (<a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/10/09-35969.pdf" target="_blank">Vernor v. AutoDesk</a>) and felt I had something to add to the conversation. And here is where I failed - I did not really know my audience. In discussing the case, I kept going on tangents essentially writing a treatise on copyright law, trying to explain every little nuance and nitty gritty detail.</p>
<p>There were two key issues with this. First, it is wasteful and silly for me to take up so much space on my blog discussing things which many other people have come along and explained quite well before me. Second, and more importantly, it was a failure on my part to know my audience. See the thing is that I do not really know my audience. I just set this up one day and started writing. I did not tell my friends or family or basically anyone that it was here. Anyone looking for me could probably find it, but I did not alert anyone of its presence. In not knowing who is out there reading this, it was difficult to appropriately target them with my writing. So I tried to write to target anyone with a pulse.</p>
<p>So, here I was with a pretty good idea botching it entirely on execution. I knew I was floundering and things were going too far so I scrapped that post. I started again with some other such interesting topic. And I did the same thing again. In my attempt to package it such that anyone could follow along, my writing quickly became dry, boring, and extremely lengthy as I tried to explain base concepts. This failure to know my audience and write to the appropriate level again doomed me because I kept thinking, &#8220;maybe I should explain this&#8221; and &#8220;maybe they do not know that&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly I believe it is somewhat pointless to write at such a level that no one can understand what is going on and it takes one skilled in the art to parse it. On the other hand, it is also wasteful to attempt to explain everything in such gory detail that a child could comprehend but that no one would ever read due to its prolixity.</p>
<p>I consider this is a valuable lesson to have learned. <strong>Know your audience.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Further, I realized that <strong>in my attempt to satisfy any given reader, I was ultimately satisfying <em>no one.</em></strong>&nbsp;This is an extremely important lesson.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">With that said, I will attempt to go down the path of writing my substantive tidbits and hopefully having more frequent updates, but I will target an audience that is capable, intelligent, curious, but not skilled in the art. I will write as though I were talking to some of my close friends that fit this description. By doing so, I will be able to write fluid, pointed substance which I would enjoy reading if I were to come upon it. If you do not fall into that category, I apologize, but there are many other blogs out there that may better satisfy your needs.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">* T</span></strong>he fallacy of the &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to do X&#8221; argument will have its own post at a later date.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
