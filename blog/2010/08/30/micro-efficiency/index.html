<div class="entry-content"><p>There are many things which are inefficient in the world. I am constantly looking for ways to optimize everyday things in order to make things more efficient in order to reduce wasteful efforts and allow people to spend more time focusing on that which is really important in their lives. I like to split these things into two separate categories, <strong>micro-efficiency</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>macro-efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p />
<div>The reason I split these into two categories is that I see them as fundamentally different challenges which can be generalized in much the same manner as economics. In that field, micro-economics is the study of localized things such as one&#8217;s own personal finances whereas macro-economics is the study of economic issues at a global scale. These two, though related, are quite different from one another in analysis and method.</div>
<p />
<div>I have many theories, ideas, etc. on an everyday basis about macro-efficiency, however I will not discuss that in this post. This post will focus on micro-efficiency.<br />
<p />
<div>One thing that I constantly see is some iteration of the following. I am walking with someone to their car, or their apartment and they wait until they get to their door then they decide to go and pull out their keys while we are standing there at the locked entryway, unable to enter until they finish rummaging through their purse or pocket. The same happens when walking to a car or any other such locked device. And, as far as I have seen, most people seem to exhibit this behavior.</div>
<div>And, most people seem to think nothing of it, but to me it is jarring. Why not pull the keys out while you are walking? It takes no more effort to reach into your pocket 30 seconds earlier and do the same process. My suspicion is that most people do not notice/care. Their brains think, &#8220;walk to the car, walk to the car&#8221; and when they get there, they think &#8220;get out your keys, get out your keys&#8221;. They do not seem to think &#8220;walk to the car, car requires keys for entry, let me get out my keys so they are ready for allowing us to get into the car&#8221;. The former is something I do not seem to understand, our brains are capable of much more than simple serial instructions. There is no extra time or effort expended in someone reaching for their keys whilst walking to their car, they just decided to use their brains and start the action a bit sooner.</div>
<p />
<div>Certainly, most people would brush this off as trivial and call me a nitpicking idiot. I have no illusions about this. However, it just doesn&#8217;t seem to make any sense to me. I think of how most people probably do this every time they get to their car or to the locked door of their home and how they &#8220;waste&#8221; 10 seconds every time. I think of how most people do this multiple times per day, let&#8217;s say at least three (going out to car in the morning, getting back into car after work, opening the door at home), often more. That&#8217;s 3.5 minutes per week, a little over 3 hours per year, and ~10 days over the course of the average lifetime. In the U.S. alone, if half the population does this, it equates to a bit more than 513&nbsp;centuries wasted per year.</div>
<p />
<div>This may not sound like much on a per-person basis, but this is just one of many needlessly time-wasting behaviors in which people regularly engage. How often do you see someone at the grocery store checkout line who waits to hear what the total is before they start digging through their purse for their wallet, then look for their card, then say, &#8220;oh yeah, i have this coupon&#8221; instead of having their card out and ready as they know payment is imminent. Or go to a vending machine and do the same thing, instead of pulling out their wallet, getting the dollar ready on their way there and having it ready to insert as soon as they get there?</div>
<p />
<div>Now, certainly some would argue that there is just cause for taking longer to do some things, particularly if one is on the clock and are paid whether they are doing work or standing at the vending machine making a choice, but for things such as their car keys, it adds up quickly. It could also be argued that time spent standing outside your car by yourself affords more time for self-reflexitivity. While a decent argument, let&#8217;s be serious, who honestly spends that extra time doing anything productive?</div>
<p />
<div>And this does not just have an effect over the span of someone&#8217;s lifetime. If someone is running late for a meeting, some seconds spent rummaging through their purse while standing still at their car, which could have been done at the same time as they walked toward it, could make a significant difference.</div>
<p />
<div>My main point in all of this is not that everyone truly needs to save 30 seconds per day, but why is it that most people waste 30 seconds per day needlessly? We as humans are endowed with a wonderfully capable computing device which can allow us to do some incredible things. Why not put it to use so we can save those extra moments to witness things that actually matter to us. Those 30 seconds wasted on fumbling for keys from leaving home to getting back from work may be all one needs to catch their child&#8217;s first steps.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>This type of micro-efficiency, when applied to many everyday tasks, could quickly add up to saving significant, non-trivial amounts of time, otherwise needlessly wasted and all it takes is a little extra thought and attention to detail.</div>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
