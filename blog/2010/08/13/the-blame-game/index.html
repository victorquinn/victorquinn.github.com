<div class="entry-content"><p>I was playing a silly game on my cell phone the other day and, for a bit, it was pretty frustrating. But I kept retrying the level that was giving me trouble until I mastered the technique and moved beyond it. It gave me pause and made me think about how many people would react to such a situation.</p>
<p />
<div>Many people would&nbsp;quickly give up and blame the game. They&#8217;d say, &#8220;this game is too hard&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not a game of skill, it&#8217;s a game of luck&#8221; or &#8220;the controls for this game are crappy&#8221;. They may immediately look online for someone else&#8217;s solution or cheat codes because they do not want to figure it out for themselves. This happens&nbsp;all the time in&nbsp;other games as well, in tennis, players blame their racket or the net, in golf, people blame the clubs or the wind or what they had for lunch or their pants. While these things can certainly be factors contributing to their failures,&nbsp;rarely does one blame themselves and decide they have to practice harder or improve a certain aspect of their play. It is far easier to blame the game than to blame themselves.</div>
<p />
<div>And this moves beyond games into the realm of reality. Many people blame delays in projects at work on other people, they blame traffic if they arrive late. Seldom does someone take responsibility for their actions and say, &#8220;the project is late because I had difficulty prioritizing things&#8221; or &#8220;I arrived late because I did not allot enough time for travel&#8221;. It is quick and easy to pass the blame off on an inanimate object or something which is out of a person&#8217;s control because then it seems to most people that &#8220;it could not be helped&#8221;.</div>
<p />
<div>It is difficult to avoid the blame game and admit fault when something does not go as planned. Often there could be consequences if something, such as a project at work, is late due to something fully within the employee&#8217;s control. So they pass the blame off to some nebulous, unexplained nothing in the clouds so it is no longer within their control and they do not fear disciplinary action as a result. Part of this is the fault of the employee for passing blame instead of taking responsibility for their actions, but part of it is also the fault of the employer for their reaction to misplaced blame and how they would react if the employee were perfectly honest with them. Personally, if I were an employer, I would much rather my employee tell me she was late because she needed to sleep in a bit than passing the blame off to something, or someone else. However, it seems to me that this is not the way most employers would react.</div>
<p />
<div>Now, I do not intend to generalize and assume that every time some project is late or there is some error it is within the control of the person affected by it, in fact often things truly are completely out of someone&#8217;s control. The key there is recognizing those moments and differentiating them from aimless blame transference. Transferring blame is a great way not only to avoid any responsibility but also to never learn, adapt, and grow. If I blame my tardiness on traffic, then I will not change my behavior because traffic is out of my control. If however I realize that it was my failure to allot ample time for my travel, then I can adjust accordingly and arrive in a timely fashion, even if traffic intervenes.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>If everyone took a little time to be self-analyzing and note where they usually place blame, they will likely notice that it is seldom merited and that they can improve themselves greatly by righting the behaviors that lead to those issues.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Don&#8217;t play the blame game, it is a game where everybody loses, no one improves, and dishonesty takes precedence.</div>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
