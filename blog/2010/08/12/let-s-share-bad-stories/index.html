<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things I have never really understood about people is their predisposition to telling tales of misery. Why is this? Why don&#8217;t most people want to share tales of joy?</p>

<p>To illustrate, I will give a couple of examples.</p>

<p>If two people are standing by the water cooler and one bitches about how his wife made him take out the trash, the other can bitch about how his wife made him fix the plumbing. Both employees have shared their crappy story and feel a sense of bonding with the other. In their shared misery, they have found a common ground.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that scenario playing out as follows, two people standing by the water cooler. One comes up and tells the other about how he worked hard, did some other work on the side and saved money and went on an awesome trip for his birthday with his wife who made him an awesome birthday dinner, and they had great adventures followed by incredible sex for hours. The other person will likely feel awkward and want to sneak away. This is not a generally socially acceptable story.</p>

<p>But why is this the reaction? It would seem as though people would want to hear good things about others and it would fill them with joy as well. However, there is something else at play there.&nbsp;My best guess is that it comes to an odd social rule, fueled primarily by envy. When one person tells the story of something awesome, the other has a feeling of envy. He feels sad that he has not earned such a trip and that his wife did not do all of that awesome stuff for him last weekend, he does not have a relatable story, so the two employees do not connect. He secretly wishes he had some similar story of awesome, but instead of trying himself to work hard to earn it as his colleague has, he gives up, resolving that his situation is different from the other employee&#8217;s and that his life is different. Thus a rift is created between the two instead of a common bonding point.</p>

<p>Most people like to complain, they complain about their wives, their crappy situations, etc. And when someone shares a story of joy or something they have earned, it is frowned upon as gloating. My question is: <em>When did people stop being proud of their achievements and begin suppressing them?</em> That seems like madness to me.</p>

<p>When someone tells me a story of something awesome that has happened to them as a result of their work, effort, or wisdom, instead of being filled with discomfort or envy, it fills me with nothing but passion and a desire to work harder such that I may achieve equivalent or better things. It seems to me this is the way everyone should behave for it fosters a race to the top instead of a race to the bottom with everyone striving to achieve more instead of everyone striving to have a miserable life so they can have relatable stories.</p>

<p>Further, hearing a happy, excited tale gets me happy and excited whereas hearing a depressing tale gets me depressed. In my view, anyone who wishes that others suppress their tales of joy and instead tell tales of sorrow is jealous and unable to achieve greatness themselves. This may be a narrow viewpoint but I see no other logical reason for such behavior. While I do not intend to change people and this attribute of their behavior, I do intend to surround myself with people who are willing and able to achieve greatness and do not shy away from stories of great things they or others around them have earned.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
