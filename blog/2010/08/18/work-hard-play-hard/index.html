<div class="entry-content"><p>It is common that people wish they could just stop working. When someone is confronted with the &#8220;what would you do if you had a million dollars&#8221; question, most people assume they will stop working and try to find something extravagant/outlandish. But would they really want to stop doing everything and just lay around? I&#8217;d be willing to bet nearly anything that anyone who does nothing but lay around will quickly get bored. I think the concept of doing nothing is a backlash against being &#8220;forced&#8221; into doing things they do not want to do in order to pay their bills.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:YshQTH4dp5fiGbRat002]]</p>
<p>And of course, a bit of it is that when someone goes &#8220;on vacation&#8221;, they frequently pay through the nose for good experiences, eat out all of the time, etc. This further makes the concept of vacation so alluring, because most people do not behave this way in their everyday life, so not only is vacation a chance to get away from their work, it is also an excuse to open their wallets. A million dollars would not last long if spent in this manner, so the common answer to what most people would do is not really reasonable. In actuality, they may have enough to literally sit around and live off of the interest, but that&#8217;s about it. And, while sitting in your sweatpants watching TV is great for a short while, it will quickly grow old. <p /> When most people take vacations, they are great because they are a break from the doldrums of everyday life. However, without something to take a break from, not working loses a lot of its allure. When you have slaved for awhile, the feeling of exultation upon leaving said bondage is immeasurable. On the other hand, if you have been sitting around all day and you decide you &#8220;need a break&#8221; from sitting around, that break will be far less enticing. Like a piece of bread to a starving man, it is the differential, the hunger, which gives the bread such an amazing taste.</p>
<p>In my life, I always try to work hard, not only in my job, but in other things in life. I work harder than most people because I constantly seek to better myself. Whether it be a job skill or something mundane like a Rubik&#8217;s cube (yes, I can solve one, and quickly), I always see room for improvement.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:bCxdbJDfltAxvrsGcAlb]]</p>
<p>I was told once that I am &#8220;good at everything I try.&#8221; I say this not to flaunt my abilities, but rather to point out that it is not through random happenstance that I am good at many things. It is through consistent, hard work improving these, often otherwise useless, abilities. Outside observers look at me and see someone who just magically seems to excel at things. What they don&#8217;t see is the many hours spent late at night perfecting those skills. <p /> It is from this hard work and determination that I get such an intense joy when I get a break from my everyday routine. When I am away and spend the time solely on my enjoyment of life and the world, it is quite refreshing. But I truly believe that if I did not work as hard as I do at most things, most of the allure of a vacation would be lost. Even just taking a few days off to relax around the house was amazing. If I had every day off to sit around my house and relax, I doubt I would appreciate it as much as I do when I&#8217;m working hard. <p /> Back to the million dollars question, if I had a million dollars, I could not count the things I would try to do and nearly all of them most others would consider work. I want to create, I want to make great things that can change the world or otherwise impact people, I want to get others to look at the world from a different perspective and change their priorities. I want to make people realize what is important in life and how amazing it all is if you take the time to appreciate it. There is so much I want to do and none of it will get done if I spend my days sitting on my couch in my sweatpants watching TV.</p>
<p><br />I do not desire an infinite lifetime of doing nothing, in fact that sounds like a kind of torture to me. So, when I do take a break, I like to do it in style because I know I have earned it. Work hard, Play hard.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you're doing it wrong.</p>
