  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ugh. Just seeing the word makes me cringe. The weekend after Christmas, I moved
into a new place. I am at once excited about my new home and the prospect of a
new beginning while frustrated at the ridiculous time sink it has become.</p>

<p>Things were not (for reasons on which I will not elaborate) working out at our
old place, so we packed up everything we owned and now have a fresh start in a
a new townhouse.</p>

<p>I sit here, surrounded by boxes and bare walls, having already spent an
untold number of days putting every one of my worldly possessions into those
boxes just to remove them upon arrival at this new house, and knowing I&#8217;ll spend
many more taking my stuff out of those boxes before reaching the end.</p>

<p>Things are good and I am overall quite happy, but if someone told me, &#8220;you will
have to stop all work on anything productive for the next 2 months while you
do nothing but pick your stuff up here and put it away on the other side&#8221; I&#8217;d
have told them to shove something somewhere where things aren&#8217;t meant to shoved.</p>

<p>Instead of being a lot further along building <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a> I
have moved my stuff from over there to over here. &lt;sarcasm>Awesome.
&lt;/sarcasm></p>

<p>The first few days here were exciting:
- Look at all the organizing I can do!
- Everything can be put in its rightful place
- Clean all the things!
- There are so many possibilities</p>

<p>But now that the honeymoon period has worn off, I&#8217;m left with a ton of boxes and
little motivation. I&#8217;ve put away and dealt with the fun things, all that&#8217;s left
is the tedious boring stuff. I&#8217;ll slog through it and my wife will no doubt help
keep me motivated but man is it a drag.</p>

<p>I. Hate. Moving.</p>

<time datetime="2012-12-23T15:19:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 23<span>rd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/cloud9.png"></p>

<p>I have been following <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a> since their early
days. I was thrilled at their open source editor, <a href="http://ace.ajax.org">Ace</a>
(formerly Bespin) and actually wrote a
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1377948">Drupal WYSIWYG plugin</a> to allow it as an option
for HTML editing in Drupal.</p>

<p>But, when I originally looked at Cloud9, as neat as it was to be able to edit
files in the cloud, it wasn&#8217;t really too useful for much.</p>

<p>Just recently a co-worker sent me a link to some code he had written using it
with some client-side javascript code. It was nothing short of magical.</p>

<p>This. Changes. Everything.</p>

<p>Wondering what it&#8217;ll be like to develop in the future? Just try out Cloud9.</p>

<h2>Direct git Integration</h2>

<p>Cloud9 can pair with your <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> or
<a href="http://bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a> account and pull in all the code in any of your
repositories. So with just the click of a button you&#8217;re up and running with your
code. That&#8217;s pretty awesome.</p>

<p>But they actually had this awhile back when I tried it (though it now is even
more fluid and awesome). What has changed?</p>

<h2>The old problem</h2>

<p>Code editing in the cloud was neat and all, but I had to commit any changes I
made so I could check them out locally or on my webserver so I could test it and
see if it blew everything up or fixed the problem I was trying to solve.</p>

<p>This led to a tortured workflow involving committing sometimes not working code
in Cloud9, checking it out locally, running it, seeing if it worked or broke,
editing and bugfixing it locally, committing that, then going back to work in
Cloud9. As I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, Cloud9 quickly dropped out of my workflow
and I went back to just editing everything locally.</p>

<h2>The solution arrives!</h2>

<p>Imagine my surprise and wonder upon most recently checking out Cloud9 when it
had the ability to run code, in your browser! It can easily handle node.js,
rails, I&#8217;m sure more. It even handled this Jekyll-based blog with ease! In fact
I am editing this now, in Cloud9!</p>

<p>It has GUI shortcuts for things like git commands, npm install/uninstall, and
more, but it also allows you to drop directly into a terminal and run commands
there! It&#8217;s just like having your own server with none of the headache.</p>

<h2>Always in sync across systems</h2>

<p>One of my favorite benefits of this approach is that everything is, by its
nature always in sync across systems. I can pick up my laptop, do some work,
then move to my desktop, open Cloud9 and everything is just as I left it. I
could go sit down in a random computer lab or library and still be in sync and
ready to roll.</p>

<p>This last bit, in my opinion, is the most powerful feature of this kind
of Cloud programming. For $0, I can have an always in sync IDE operable from any
browser, my own cloud server, and more. It took awhile for the gravity of this
to sink in, but this is pretty amazing. The barrier to entry for programming
with a server has never been lower</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to discuss that I&#8217;m not touching on here, just wanted to hit
some of the quick highlights. I&#8217;m trying to work this into my workflow more so
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more thoughts later.</p>

<p>This is seriously awesome and feels like the future&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I officially announce the initial launch of the new website for my startup called <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/scales-icon.png" width="256" height="256"></p>

<p>Named for the implement held in one hand by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice">Lady Justice</a>, Scales will focus on creating innovative learning solutions for law students.</p>

<p>More info is available on the <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a> site, but in brief my goal is to meld my knowledge of the law with my skills as a software architect and build something unlike anything else that currently exists. Scales will offer a fresh new take on legal supplements, bringing them into the 21st century.</p>

<p>For the tech nerds out there, Scales is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> application which will serve as the central repository for info, study materials, quiz questions, and other learning content. I will then build out a web experience directly in Rails using <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> to ensure it&#8217;s snappy along with an iOS app which will communicate to that main web app via an API. Content and progress created in the Rails app will by seamlessly synchronized to the iOS app and vice versa with some intelligent caching so lack of connectivity will never be blocking.</p>

<p>With my rich background in software development building APIs, my plan is to be able to offer a top notch, fully integrated experience for legal education unlike any other currently out there which is also open for future expansion to Android devices or desktop applications or whatever else the future may have in store. (Direct mindlink anybody?)</p>

<p>I am flying solo on this project so progress may seem somewhat slow at the start, but will always be steady and I hope to have a true initial launch with content for a core set of courses sometime in Spring 2013. Please stay tuned for updates and if you are interested please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:mail@victorquinn.com?subject=Scales">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime any posts relating to Scales will be tagged appropriately and can all be viewed <a href="http://victorquinn.com/blog/categories/scales/">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>For reference, a screenshot of the old design:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/oldstyle.png"></p>

<p>I wanted to redesign to make it cleaner and simpler, to better highlight the content, and to move to something which felt a bit less constrained with some more fun colors. I had grown bored of the green everywhere. I&#8217;m quite pleased with the outcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the nice things about working for a political company is the ability to work in a fast-moving field, especially close to election time.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago Google came out with a new API called <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Civic</a> which allows you to pass in an address and get back a bunch of information related to voting in the upcoming election. It will return things such as polling places, candidates, and other election information.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/google.png"></p>

<p>Our company took this to task and created a Drupal module which interacts with this new API service so people can easily add a &#8220;Find my polling place&#8221; widget to their Drupal website. This should hopefully get more people informed about the election and getting out to vote.</p>

<p>For my part, I took the Drupal 6 version created by my co-workers and ported it to Drupal 7. I also added (Drupal 7 only for now) some other cool info based on your address such as information on the relevant contests and links to the candidate pages so voters can be well informed going into election day.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favorite git tricks is the ability to commit only part of a file. This is a short but sweet tip.</p>

<p>Just use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git add -p filename.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will ask you whether or not to stage each hunk of the file so you can commit that awesome change you made at the top, not stage the middle piece which is still a work in progress, and stage the piece at the bottom your team member needs to keep making progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sharing a minor tweak which has been very useful to me.</p>

<p>I find I often want to cd into the directory where a program exists. Let&#8217;s say I was trying to jump to the directory which contained <em>myawesomeprogram</em> but didn&#8217;t know where it was. My old workflow was something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>which myawesomeprogram
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Manually click/drag to copy and paste the resulting output</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> &lt;pasted directory&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Come on, I&#8217;m an übernerd, surely I can figure out something better/more efficient which doesn&#8217;t require me to touch my mouse.</p>

<h2>Enter a simple zsh function</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net">zsh</a> for my shell. I think this should work with bash though YMMV.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cdw <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="k">$(</span>dirname <span class="k">$(</span>which <span class="nv">$1</span><span class="k">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Adding this to my .zshrc allows me to just type</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cdw myawesomeprogram
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and I&#8217;m immediately teleported to the folder which contains that program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>I created a git repo with a framework for testing Drupal sites using Capybara webkit and RSpec so any Drupal developers can just clone it and go.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/victorquinn/drupal-capybara">View project on Github</a></p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The first question I&#8217;m likely to get here is &#8220;Why?&#8221; Drupal has its own testing framework <a href="http://drupal.org/simpletest">SimpleTest</a> which can be used for both Unit and Functional tests, so why try to use RSpec/Ruby? Also, SimpleTest has access to all of the Drupal-y goodness, why write functional tests in Ruby where those functions would not be available?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a great question. In my case I&#8217;m trying to run tests on a Drupal instance that is on a different machine. In my case I&#8217;m trying to run the tests from by desktop and hit my production web server which is on an offsite clustered server. Here SimpleTest wouldn&#8217;t fit the bill. These tests allow me to take into account network latency and such.</p>

<p>Note, of course since these tests are not in Drupal, tests written and performed like this will not do the setup/teardown like SimpleTest. So I would strongly suggest only touching data on test websites.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>First, test that ruby exists and is the right version.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ruby -v
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I used ruby 1.9.3-p194 managed by <a href="https://rvm.io">rvm</a> but I believe any 1.9+ version of ruby should work here with Capybara.</p>

<p>Next, clone my repo which is basically a skeleton setup ready to test Drupal using Capybara. In the repo I&#8217;ve included a file called default.config.yaml. You will want to copy that file to config.yaml. The Gemfile should be set up to install all necessary dependencies.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/victorquinn/drupal-capybara.git
</span><span class='line'>cp default.config.yaml config.yaml
</span><span class='line'>bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now edit config.yaml and change the values to match the Drupal site you are testing.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">site</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://mycoolwebsite.com&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">user</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">myusername</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">password</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">abcd1234</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Is it working?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve included two sample tests, one which will just check to ensure the site can be hit and the second which should try logging in to your Drupal site using the values in config.yaml. I&#8217;ve tested this both on Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 and works out of the box on both.</p>

<p>Try to run the tests and ensure things work. Go to the root of that directory (drupal-capybara by default) and try to run it! (do not try to run this from inside the spec directory, you&#8217;ll get errors.)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>rspec spec
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should see something like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>Finished in 4.23 seconds
</span><span class='line'>2 examples, 0 failures
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The warnings can be safely ignored. I am not sure exactly why they&#8217;re there, something to do with the way the Capybara webkit code is with Mountain Lion. But it&#8217;s just a warning and doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with our web tests.</p>

<p>Note: The login test I included will only work if your system has not altered the login page. If something has changed the Log In button to say &#8220;Login&#8221; or &#8220;Go&#8221; or &#8220;Submit&#8221; or anything else, the test will fail. This is one of the downsides of trying to write tests for Drupal in a system that is not associated with Drupal &#8211; it cannot dynamically know about anything which has changed internal to Drupal.</p>

<p>** Capybara webkit can be a bit of a tricky beast to get installed on your system with dependencies and such. <a href="#troubleshooting_webkit">Jump to the bottom</a> to see more details on some possible solutions.</p>

<p>Now test that tests fail correctly by changing your password in config.yaml to a bad value and run it again.</p>

<p>Here failure is a good thing! Shouldn&#8217;t be able to log in if the password is wrong. Don&#8217;t forget to change your password back in config.yaml before moving on.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a full rspec tutorial as such, but with my example tests that should be a good start. I&#8217;ve included a third sample test of filling out a Drupal form in my code (specifically in <em>spec/drupal_capybara_spec.rb</em>, but it&#8217;s commented out by default because that&#8217;s kind of specific to the particulars of the site and I didn&#8217;t want to send this out with tests likely to fail on most systems.</p>

<p>I should note, you can also run RSpec to get a nice HTML output. Just run the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>open results.html
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>You should be all set and ready to write some tests!</em></p>

<h2><a id="troubleshooting_webkit"></a>Troubleshooting Capybara Webkit</h2>

<p>Not to sugar coat things, I found Capybara Webkit pretty painful to get installed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll help with the issues I overcame, but generally it will likely involve some googling and such as it&#8217;s very dependent on the particulars of the system on which this is being run. For reference, I am on Mountain Lion (10.8.2) using ruby 1.9.3-p194. I also use <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">HomeBrew</a> to manage packages.</p>

<p>If you get the following error:</p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s likely qt is not installed on your system. I resolved this by running:</p>

<p>Mentioned above, but if you&#8217;re on Mountain Lion you will likely see a warning such as:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but it can safely be ignored.</p>

<p>If all else fails and you cannot get Webkit working on your system, Selenium can be used instead of Capybara Webkit so all this magic still works, just using Selenium instead of Webkit.</p>

<h3>Alternative setup with Selenium</h3>

<p>To use Selenium instead of headless Webkit, simply edit the drupal_capybara_spec.rb file as follows:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a trivial post of sorts.</p>

<p>There are 52 weeks in the year. My company follows 2 week sprints for development using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development">Scrum</a>).</p>

<p>52 divided by 2 yields 26.</p>

<p>How many letters are in the alphabet? Oh right, 26.</p>

<p>So using the letters A-Z it is possible to represent each sprint uniquely by just a letter of the alphabet just like hurricanes or Ubuntu.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s make sprint planning, a generally dry and boring affair, interesting.</p>

<p>Since I began leading sprints in my role as team lead with my current employer, my team has planned each sprint using a letter of the alphabet. But not just a letter of the alphabet, we&#8217;ve used the first letter to represent some adjective and the second to represent a mythical god.</p>

<p>We have had such gems as Entropic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(mythology)">Echo</a>, Fab <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna">Fortuna</a>, Hapless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra">Hydra</a>, Gravid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhead">Godhead</a>, and we are currently nearing the end of Jovial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah">Jah</a>.</p>

<p>I am hardly the first one to think of this, but it has done us well and adds some much needed jazz to an otherwise boring affair.</p>

<p>In the midst of one of the most tiresome aspects of development, the sprint planning, we begin a debate on which adjective/mythical being pair would best represent our current sprint. Excellent and enjoyable arguments ensue as each person argues that their adjective/god pair most closely resembles the sprint we have just planned. The monotony has been cut with an amusing nonsensical argument about how Entropic this sprint is or the etymology of God vs. Godhead vs. Gaia. What does it mean to be a God? Amusement rises from a once dry conversation as an excited debate ignites. Developers who were once dreary of the seemingly endless task of planning the coming weeks spring to life in an attempt to argue that their pairing of adjective and god is most apt.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ve done so against resistance. I have been told that company policy forbade such a tactic, that tradition was to name the sprint by the (boring) start and end date and to diverge was verboten. I now technically name sprints by the start and end date, but tack on my team consensus amusing god name as a suffix. Since &#8220;Ardent Atlas&#8221; was forbidden, we now have &#8220;May 22 - June 5, Bashful Baal&#8221; to appease the powers that be while maintaining autonomy and team spirit.</p>

<p>The thing I love most about this is that there is no trickery here. This is not like the spoon zoomed toward the infant like it&#8217;s an airplane while the spoon holder mockingly looks down upon the infant as, well, infantile. Rather this is just a moment to enjoy the company of other intellectuals and have a respectful debate about something downright silly and frankly nonsensical to mix things up. It is an excuse to forget about the nitty gritty details of the boring nature of what had just been planned and just wax philosophically and passionately about definitions and minutiae in a manner which few other sectors af the human race would appreciate as much as developers happen to.</p>

<p>Keeping developers happy is arguably the greatest challenge in the management of software engineers and this little trivial tidbit has added some nice spice to an otherwise boring dish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Warm malt extract during brewing so less is wasted.</h2>

<p>When I start the homebrew process, the first step of which is sanitizing all my equipment, I first plug one of my sinks, put my liquid malt extract into it (still in its containers), then fill it with hot water.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/lme1.png"></p>

<p>I pick up the liquid malt extract container from time to time and give it a shake to evenly distribute it throughout the container. I also periodically drain and refresh the hot water it&#8217;s bathed in to keep it hot as the malt extract absorbs the heat. This also melts the glue so the labels can be pulled off easily. You&#8217;ll see in my image above that one has its label all the way off and the other is starting to peel. Removing this makes doubly sure that nothing falls into the wort.</p>

<p>By doing this, it makes the malt extract much more viscous (read: runny) so when it comes time to add it to the wort, less is wasted because more of it runs out while pouring and less sticks to the inside of the container.</p>

<p>Bonus: If using a plastic container with a lid (for example with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5XAQK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000V5XAQK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=victorqcom-20" title="">Briess Liquid Malt Extract</a>) you can do as above, but also, after pouring out the malt extract, you can fill this plastic container with hot water from the tap, shake it around, and pour it into the wort. This will ensure even more of your malt extract makes its way into the wort and little is wasted. This can also be done with an aluminum can but it will be less efficient.</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Rochester, NY. My early career aspirations included nearly anything imaginable at one point or another, but I always gravitated toward the realms of science and logic.</p>
  <p>Upon graduating from high school, I ventured to Massachusetts where I spent the next 10 years of my life becoming educated in Computer Science, Physics, and the Law.</p>
  <p>In parallel, I spent most of those years working as a professional software engineer in the field of education, first at <a href="http://www.umass.edu" target=_blank>UMass Amherst</a> and then at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target=_blank>Amherst College.</a>
  <p>After graduating from Law School, I moved down to Northern Virginia in search of warmer weather and a chance to enjoy life in a different region of the country. I also used this opportunity to change pace in my day-to-day, now working for <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com" target=_blank>NGP VAN</a>, a company specializing in political software. I am truly enjoying bringing my experience developing for the education sector while at the same time learning about the entirely different realm of politics.</p>
  <p>On the side I am working on building my new legal learning startup, <a href="http://scalesapp.com">Scales</a>. I am also constantly expanding my knowledge of programming and the law while living with both my wife Susan and our great dane Stella.</p>
  <p>Life is excellent and if you think otherwise, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
